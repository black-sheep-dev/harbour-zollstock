## Accuracy
The app uses the pixel density per millimeter reported by the device to calibrate the scale. It is possible to influence this with a scaling factor inside the settings.

However, the overall accuray is determined by the pixel size. The larger a pixel, the worse the accuracy. The pixel density is a double value that is rounded for display.
